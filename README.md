## Overview
### Description
Seam is the sustainable marketplace made for students, by students. It is an iOS application which ensures that material that could be reused is not discarded but instead can be listed to a broader target audience: fellow college students.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** ecommerce, marketplace, product listing app
- **Mobile:** it is created as an iOS app, using Swift and prototyped using Figma, however, can be implemented as a web-based application as well.
- **Story:** 
- It is move out week and a student is considering what to do with their old textbooks and dorm desk which they do not need anymore. They realize they could sell it to another fellow student who may need it instead of throwing it in the local dump. They hope for a solution to this problem so another person could benefit from what they don't feel the use to keep anymore. Enter Seam.
- This user wants an efficient app that can allow them to list products they are considering selling based on a target audience without much effort needed. Their secondhand textbooks for example could be used by a student in an introductory class. Seam provides this by creating categories where users can place their listings and have a better chance of connecting with a student who may be interested in what they are selling. 
- Market: this app is targeted towards students, especially college-aged ones.
Habit: This app was designed with accessibility in mind- though the user can enter the app at any time to check listings, it might be more common to pull it up during move out weeks and the end of the semester period.
Scope: I primarily worked on implementing the listing by category features that I desired in Seam
Starting out, the main feature to build is the recommendation aspect. Having this can set it apart from just being another social media application and actually provide users with a reason to use the application. Being that the app is themed on travel, the social aspect is the next step, as users will naturally want to share their explorations. Having a way to add more data to the users likes will also benefit the recommender as it can then provide more accurate recommendations in a more efficient, hassle-free way.
